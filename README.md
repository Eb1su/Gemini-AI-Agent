# Gemini AI Agent
This is an AI Agent developed alongside the boot.dev backend course!

 It features use of the Google Gemini API to:
- Write to files
- Read and output file metadata
- Read and output file contents
- Execute Python Files and display output

It also features the ability for functions and their results to be chained together to work towards a final result depending on what the user asks for.

**Usage of this program requires the user to generate and link their own Google Gemini API key.**
